# metamodel-sol

**metamodel-sol** is an implementation of **typed Petri-nets** in Solidity.  
It provides a foundation for expressing smart contract behavior as composable models rather than ad-hoc code.  

## Features

- Typed Petri-nets as first-class Solidity contracts  
- Clear semantics for tokens, wallets, and allowances  
- Correct-by-construction design: logic comes directly from models  
- Supports standards like **GRC-20** and future model compositions  

## Why

Instead of writing smart contracts as scattered functions,  
`metamodel-sol` encodes behavior as **nets of states and transitions**.  
This makes contracts more transparent, auditable, and evolvable.  

## Status

- Early stage, experimental  
- Implements GRC-20 flows with extensible model definitions
